That said, Email communication is often high-latency and is typically used for communication to individuals - not applications.  Email channels are particularly useful in the context of these non-application use cases, such as public health notifications.  For example, if a public health agency does not have the ability or desire to build a custom RESTful solution (e.g., creating and maintaining an endpoint to receive notifications, as well as software to consume those notifications), it is straightforward to map notifications to email addresses or aliases.</p>\n",

      "h5\n",
      "<p>WebSocket security poses several challenges specific to the channel. When implementing websockets for notifications, please keep in mind the following list of some areas of concern:</p>\n",
      "p\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>Authentication of WebSockets is not generically interoperable with JWT or other ‘Authentication header’ protocols - the <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-sockets.html#network\">JavaScript WebSocket API</a> does not include the ability to include them.</li>\n",
      "<li>Given client limitations on concurrent WebSocket connections (commonly 6), it is recommended that a single connection be able to authenticate to multiple Subscription resources.</li>\n",
      "<li>Unlike HTTP/S requests, WebSockets can be long-lived. Because of this, the case of revoking access of an active connection must be considered.</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "ul\n",
      "<h4 id=\"email-1\">Email</h4>\n",
      "h4\n",
      "<p>While the primary interface for FHIR servers is the FHIR REST API, notifications need not occur via REST. Indeed, some subscribers may be unable to maintain an outward-facing HTTP server to receive triggered notifications. For example, a public health organization may want to be notified of outbreaks of various illnesses. This can be accomplished using an <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">email</code> notification channel.</p>\n",
      "p\n",
      "<p>A client can declare its intention to receive notifications via Email by requesting a subscription with the channel type of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">email</code> and setting the endpoint to the appropriate email URI (e.g., <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mailto:public_health_notifications@example.org</code>).</p>\n",
      "p\n",
      "<p>The server will send a new message each time a notification should be sent (e.g., per event or per batch). The server will create a message based on the values present in the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/subscription-definitions.html#Subscription.channel.payload\">Subscription.channel.payload</a> and <a href=\"StructureDefinition-backport-payload-content.html\">payload content</a> fields. If a server cannot honor the requested combination, the server SHOULD reject the Subscription request rather than send unexpected email messages.</p>\n",
      "p\n",
      "<p>The email channel sets two guidelines about content:</p>\n",
      "p\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>Message Body content SHALL be human readable</li>\n",
      "<li>Message Attachments SHOULD be machine readable</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "ul\n",
      "<p>Due to these guidelines, the <a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/subscription-definitions.html#Subscription.channel.payload\">Subscription.channel.payload</a> refers to the content of the body of the message. Attachment type information can be appended as a MIME parameter, for example:</p>\n",
      "p\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>text/plain: a plain-text body with no attachment</li>\n",
      "<li>text/html: an HTML body with no attachment</li>\n",
      "<li>text/plain;attach=application/fhir+json: a plain-text body with a FHIR JSON bundle attached</li>\n",
      "<li>text/html;attach=application/fhir+xml: an HTML body with a FHIR XML bundle attached</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "ul\n",
      "<p>The <a href=\"StructureDefinition-backport-payload-content.html\">payload content</a> field SHALL be applied to any attachments and MAY be applied to body contents (depending on server implementation). However, a server must not include a body which exceeds the specified content level. For example, a server may choose to always include a standard message in the body of the message containing no PHI and vary the attachment, but cannot include PHI in the body of an email when the content is set to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">empty</code>.</p>\n",

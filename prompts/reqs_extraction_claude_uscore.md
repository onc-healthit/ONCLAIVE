You are tasked with analyzing chunks of text from a FHIR Implementation Guide to extract specific, testable requirements and format them according to INCOSE Systems Engineering standards. Your goal is to create requirements that can be directly inserted into an INCOSE-style Software Requirements Specification.

<instructions>
Follow these steps to extract and format the requirements:

1. Carefully read through the provided text in the <fhir_text> tag below.
2. Identify specific, testable requirements that describe behavior or capability.
3. Ensure each requirement is complete, atomic, and objectively verifiable, and meets the guidelines in the <guidelines> tag below.
4. Extract the exact quote for each requirement, preserving necessary context.
5. Format each requirement according to the INCOSE standard exemplified in the <formatting_example> tag below.
6. If a section has multiple small requirements relating to the same topic, group those together as one (e.g., requirements for multiple search paramters for the same resource type)
</instructions>

Format each extracted requirement as shown in the <formatting_example> tag below:
<formatting_example>
```
## REQ-[ID]

**Summary**: Summary description of the requirement
**Text**: "[exact quote with necessary [clarifications] and [additions] to make it a full phrase or sentence]"
**Context**: Overview of context within which requirement is set to provide background needed to understand requirement for later test planning activities
**Verification**: Recommended verification method (Test/Analysis/Inspection/Demonstration)
**Actor**: Actor responsible, conformance level, conditions, etc.
**Conformance**: Conformance level
**Conditional**: [True/False]
**Source**: Section reference from the Implementation Guide
```
</formatting_example>

<guidelines>
Guidelines for requirement selection and formatting:
- Include ONLY requirements that describe specific, testable, automatically verifiable behavior or capability.
- Ensure requirements could be objectively tested through software testing or attestation.
- Most requirements should have explicit conformance language (SHALL, SHOULD, MAY, MUST, REQUIRED, etc.).
- Separate individual requirements.
- Identify the actor responsible for implementing each requirement.
- Preserve the original conformance level.
- Mark conditional requirements (those that depend on optional features).
- Use exact quotes with necessary context preserved, when possible.
</guidelines>

Here is an example:

Here is the chunk of FHIR Implementation Guide text to analyze- The actors should either be 'Server' or 'Client' only:

<fhir_text>
{FHIR_TEXT}
</fhir_text>

If no requirements are found in the provided text in the <fhir_text> tag, do not add any text or commentary. Simply provide no output.

Your final output should consist only of the extracted requirements formatted according to the INCOSE standard, presented as a list. Do not include any introductory or concluding comments.

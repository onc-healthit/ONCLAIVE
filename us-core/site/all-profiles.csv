One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  ""detected"", ""not detected"", ""inconclusive"", or  ""test not done"". 

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for exceptional values.","For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.","","","","","","","",,"extensible","Codes specifying why the result (`Observation.value[x]`) is missing.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/data-absent-reason","",,,,"Observation.component.dataAbsentReason",0,1,"obs-6

","allergy | intolerance - Underlying mechanism (if known)","Identification of the underlying physiological mechanism for the reaction risk.","Allergic (typically immune-mediated) reactions have been traditionally regarded as an indicator for potential escalation to significant future risk. Contemporary knowledge suggests that some reactions previously thought to be immune-mediated are, in fact, non-immune, but in some cases can still pose a life threatening risk. It is acknowledged that many clinicians might not be in a position to distinguish the mechanism of a particular reaction. Often the term ""allergy"" is used rather generically and may overlap with the use of ""intolerance"" - in practice the boundaries between these two concepts might not be well-defined or understood. This data element is included nevertheless, because many legacy systems have captured this attribute. Immunologic testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis of the reaction and the causative substance, but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for sensitivity to a particular substance.

","Code that identifies the allergy or intolerance","Code for an allergy or intolerance statement (either a positive or a negated/excluded statement).  This may be a code for a substance or pharmaceutical product that is considered to be responsible for the adverse reaction risk (e.g., ""Latex""), an allergy or intolerance condition (e.g., ""Latex allergy""), or a negated/excluded code for a specific substance or class (e.g., ""No latex allergy"") or a general or categorical negated statement (e.g.,  ""No known allergy"", ""No known drug allergies"").  Note: the substance for a specific reaction may be different from the substance identified as the cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it. For instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a composite product that includes the identified substance. It must be clinically safe to only process the 'code' and ignore the 'reaction.substance'.  If a receiving system is unable to confirm that AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance falls within the semantic scope of AllergyIntolerance.code, then the receiving system should ignore AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance.","It is strongly recommended that this element be populated using a terminology, where possible. For example, some terminologies used include RxNorm, SNOMED CT, DM+D, NDFRT, ICD-9, IDC-10, UNII, and ATC. Plain text should only be used if there is no appropriate terminology available. Additional details can be specified in the text.When a substance or product code is specified for the 'code' element, the ""default"" semantic context is that this is a positive statement of an allergy or intolerance (depending on the value of the 'type' element, if present) condition to the specified substance/product.  In the corresponding SNOMED CT allergy model, the specified substance/product is the target (destination) of the ""Causative agent"" relationship.The 'substanceExposureRisk' extension is available as a structured and more flexible alternative to the 'code' element for making positive or negative allergy or intolerance statements.  This extension provides the capability to make ""no known allergy"" (or ""no risk of adverse reaction"") statements regarding any coded substance/product (including cases when a pre-coordinated ""no allergy to x"" concept for that substance/product does not exist).

For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  ""detected"", ""not detected"", ""inconclusive"", or  ""specimen unsatisfactory"".   

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed. Note that an observation may only be reported if there are values to report. For example differential cell counts values may be reported only when > 0.

Sometimes this is global (e.g. a national identifier) but often it is not. For this reason, none of the useful mechanisms described for working with references (e.g. chaining, includes) are possible, nor should servers be expected to be able resolve the reference. Servers may accept an identifier based reference untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy. 

When both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is preferred. Applications processing the resource are allowed - but not required - to check that the identifier matches the literal reference

Applications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the logical reference present, or remove it.

Reference is intended to point to a structure that can potentially be expressed as a FHIR resource, though there is no need for it to exist as an actual FHIR resource instance - except in as much as an application wishes to actual find the target of the reference. The content referred to be the identifier must meet the logical constraints implied by any limitations on what resource types are permitted for the reference.  For example, it would not be legitimate to send the identifier for a drug prescription if the type were Reference(Observation|DiagnosticReport).

Scores are usually a whole number, but occasionally decimals are encountered in scores.","Scores are commonly encountered in various clinical assessment scales. Assigning a value to a concept should generally be done in a formal code system that defines the value, or in an applicable value set for the concept, but some concepts do not have a formal definition (or are not even represented as a concept formally, especially in [Questionnaires](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/questionnaire.html), 
so this extension is allowed to appear ouside those preferred contexts.  Scores may even be assigned arbitrarily during use (hence, on Coding).
